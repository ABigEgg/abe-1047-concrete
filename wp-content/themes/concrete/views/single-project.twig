This question was the catalyst for a life-changing two-year community theatre project by Barlinnie prisoners, and members of the Garthamlock Community Group, led by the Citizens Theatre in partnership with New College Lanarkshire and Scottish Prison Service (SPS). Funding was provided by Creative Scotland. The project also benefited from advice and support from Families Outside and other agencies working to support families affected by imprisonment.</p>
